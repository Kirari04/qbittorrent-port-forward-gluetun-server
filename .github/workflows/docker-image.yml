# This workflow builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub.
#
# Name of the workflow
name: Docker Image CI/CD

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job builds and pushes the image
  build-and-push:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the Docker Buildx builder instance
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      # 3. Logs in to Docker Hub
      #    This step is conditional and only runs on a push event to the main branch.
      #    You must create secrets in your GitHub repository settings named DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN.
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      # 4. Extracts metadata (like tags and labels) for the Docker image
      #    This action automatically creates useful tags. For the main branch, it will create the 'latest' tag.
      #    It also creates a tag based on the commit SHA for traceability.

      # 5. Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub
      #    The 'push' parameter is conditional. It's set to 'true' only for pushes to the main branch.
      #    For pull requests, this step will only build the image to validate the Dockerfile, but won't push it.
