# This workflow builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub.
# It is configured to only push the 'latest' tag on commits to the 'main' branch.

# Name of the workflow

on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:

      # 3. Logs in to Docker Hub
      #    This step is conditional and only runs on a push event to the main branch.
